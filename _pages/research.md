My research explores the integration of <b>numerical</b> and <b>neural methods</b> for <b>physics-based simulation</b>, bridging visual computing, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in <b>differentiable fluid simulation</b>.

As Richard Feynman once said, <i>“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”</i> Guided by this idea, my long-term goal is to build the next generation of <b>AI-accelerated physics engines</b> — systems that deepen our understanding of the physical world and serve as digital twins that enable reliable prediction and informed decision-making.
