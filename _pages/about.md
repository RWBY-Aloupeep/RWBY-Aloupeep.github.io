I am a master's student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computational Mathematics. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"} and [Dr. Shihua Gong](https://www.shihua-gong.org/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}.

My research interests include <b>physics-based simulation, scientific computing, numerical methods, high-performance computing, and physics-informed artificial intelligence</b>. And, my goal is to work on building the next-generation AI-powered physics engine for the metaverse.
