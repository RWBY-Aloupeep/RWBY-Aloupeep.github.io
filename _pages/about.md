*“All men by nature desire to know.”* — Aristotle

My curiosity about the physical world guided me to pursue a master's degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of Washington. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"} and [Dr. Shihua Gong](https://www.shihua-gong.org/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}.

My research explores the integration of **numerical and neural methods** for **physics simulation** in science and engineering, with particular interests in graphics and physics. Broadly, my work bridges **visual computing**, **scientific computing**, and **artificial intelligence**, focusing on **differentiable simulation** and **neural surrogate**.

As Richard Feynman once said, *“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”* My long-term goal is to build the next generation of **AI-accelerated physics engines** — systems that not only simulate the world, but also help us understand it more deeply.
