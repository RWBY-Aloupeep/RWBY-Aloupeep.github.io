I am a master's student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computational Mathematics. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"} and [Dr. Shihua Gong](https://www.shihua-gong.org/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}.

My research interest lies in <b>physics-based simulation</b>, positioned at the intersection of <b>visual computing</b>, <b>numerical computing<b>, and <b>parallel computing</b>. I aim to contribute to the development of the next generation of <b>AI-accelerated physics engines</b>.
