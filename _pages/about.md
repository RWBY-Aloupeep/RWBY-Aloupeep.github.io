<span style="color:#ffb703;">*“All men by nature desire to know.”* — Aristotle</span>

Driven by curiosity about the physical world, I am pursuing a Master's degree in <span style="color:#0077b6; font-weight:bold;">Computational Mathematics</span> at the <span style="color:#0077b6; font-weight:bold;">University of Washington</span>. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in <span style="color:#0077b6; font-weight:bold;">Applied Mathematics</span> from the <span style="color:#0077b6; font-weight:bold;">Chinese University of Hong Kong</span>, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"} and [Dr. Shihua Gong](https://www.shihua-gong.org/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}.

My research explores the integration of **numerical** and **neural methods** for **physics simulation** in science and engineering, with particular interests in graphics and physics. Broadly, my work bridges **visual computing**, **scientific computing**, and **artificial intelligence**, focusing on **differentiable simulation** and **neural surrogate**.

As Richard Feynman once said, *“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”* My long-term goal is to build the next generation of **AI-accelerated physics engines** — systems that not only simulate the world, but also help us understand it more deeply.
