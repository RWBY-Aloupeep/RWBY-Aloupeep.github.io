<i>“All men by nature desire to know.”</i> — Aristotle

Driven by curiosity about the physical world, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics at the [University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}, where I was advised by [Dr. Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"} and [Dr. Shihua Gong](https://www.shihua-gong.org/){:target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"}.

My research explores the integration of <b>numerical</b> and <b>neural methods</b> for <b>physics-based simulation</b>, bridging visual computing, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in AI-accelerated fluid simulation.

As Richard Feynman once said, <i>“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”</i> Guided by this idea, my long-term goal is to build the next generation of <b>AI-accelerated physics engines</b> — systems that deepen our understanding of the physical world while bridging it with its digital twin.
