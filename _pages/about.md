I am a Master's student in University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I was advised by Prof. [Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people). My research interests include <b>physics-based simulation, scientific computing, and numerical methods</b>.
